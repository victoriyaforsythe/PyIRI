* Updated the documentation to include more citation information, correct
  the installation instructions, and improve the examples.
* Added logger and fixed merge conflicts between @aburrell and
  @victoriyaforsythe develop branches
* Added a function to calculate vertical TEC
* New library edp_update is added that introduces a new approach for the F1
  region modeling, where all fields are now continuous. This is important for
  the raytracing application.
* The construction of the EDP in edp_update was modified to improve the
  reliability of the code.
* Coverage status is added.
* Tests are added for edp_update.
* Regression tests are added for monthly_mean function.
* Regression tests are added for single_location function.
* Test data files are added.

  constructed for 2 levels of solar activity and then interpolated in between.

  construction of the EDP for the final result.
* Changed E-region height from 120 km to 110 km.
* Added a link in the docs to the journal publication.
* Print statements were deleted or replaced with logging messages.
